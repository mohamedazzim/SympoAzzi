Participant Dashboard Fixes & Event Security Enhancements

Implement the following fixes and rules in the Participant Dashboard of the Symposium Web App:

1. Show Actual Participant Name

When a participant logs in using their credentials, the dashboard currently displays a placeholder "Participant".

Fix it to display the actual participant name from the database or event registration record.

2. Restrict Score Visibility

After a participant submits their responses, do not display scores immediately.

Instead:

Show a message: “✅ Submission received. Please wait until the event concludes to view results.”

Display the scores only after the event duration ends (based on event end time in the database).

Prevent any API or route that leaks results before the event officially ends.

3. Enforce Full-Screen Mode

When the participant begins the event:

Automatically switch to full-screen mode.

Prevent exiting full-screen until submission or event completion.

4. Shortcut & Tab Restriction (Anti-Cheat Logic)

Implement a 3-step violation system:

Violation Count	Action
1st	Show warning alert → “⚠️ You are not allowed to use shortcuts or leave the test screen. Further attempts will eliminate you.”
2nd	Show second warning alert → “⚠️ Final warning! Another attempt will eliminate you.”
3rd	Automatically eliminate participant → Force submission, disable further participation, and show message “❌ You have been eliminated for violating event rules.”

Include the following restrictions:

Disable key combos such as Alt+Tab, Ctrl+R, Ctrl+T, Ctrl+W, F11, etc.

Detect window blur or tab switch (visibilitychange / blur events in JS).

On each detected violation, increment a warning counter and follow the table above.

5. Overall Flow

Participant logs in → Dashboard shows their actual name.

On event start → Enter full-screen mode and activate anti-cheat monitoring.

Participant attempts shortcut/tab switch → Warnings triggered (then elimination).

On submit → Show “Submission received” message, hide scores.

After event end time → Unlock and display results.

✅ Goal:
Deliver a secure, fair, and professional participant experience by:

Showing identity properly

Preventing early result exposure

Enforcing focus mode and anti-cheat logic with progressive warnings and elimination
